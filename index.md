============================================

Welcome to the documentation of the itinero transit module.

Itinero-transit is a C# library which solves routing queries over one or more public transport networks - with or without intermodal transfers.

This library is created as part of the [Open-Plannerteam](https://openplanner.team/)-project. The consumed data source are thus [Linked Connections(LC)](https://linkedconnections.org/).

 Documentation structure
 -----------------------
 
The documentation is split in broad parts:

- [Concepts](articles/index.md) explains the ideas behind the algorithms and the important entities in the code. Reading this part gives an high-level insight in what the library exactly does and is capable of.
- [Using the library](docs/index.html) shows the nuts and bolts of using the library in your project.
- The [Library reference](api/index.md) exposes all the classes and methods - the reference manual to deep dive into the library.
