Remarks:

The software itself is MIT. However, when using the default router for walks between stops, data from OpenStreetMap is used. Therefore you'll have to add a copyright notice to OSM. (Unless you don't use those footpaths, e.g. when only using station-to-station routing or when writing your own router based on another dataset).

We also heavily encourage you to visualize the routes on an OpenStreetMap-background. Not only because the footpaths will neatly match, but because it fits the philosophy of the project quite well. It'll make the author happy!

Keep in mind that public transport providers might enforce other restrictions on their data.
