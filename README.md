[![Build status](https://build.anyways.eu/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:anyways_Openplannerteam_ItineroTransit)/statusIcon)](https://build.anyways.eu/viewType.html?buildTypeId=anyways_Openplannerteam_ItineroTransit)  

This is a C# implementation of a client consuming [Linked Connections](https://linkedconnections.org/) to plan transit routes. This is going to replace (or become part of) the current unfinished [transit module](https://github.com/itinero/transit) in [tinero](http://www.itinero.tech/).
