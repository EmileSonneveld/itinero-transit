# itinero-iransit

This is a C# implementation of a client consuming on [Linked Connections](https://linkedconnections.org/) to plan transit routes. This is going to replace (or become part of) the current unfinished [transit module](https://github.com/itinero/transit) in [tinero](http://www.itinero.tech/).
